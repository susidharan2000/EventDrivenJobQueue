## Event-Driven Job Queue

A single-node, crash-resilient background job system (Mini Sidekiq / Celery)

## What this is

A persistent, event-driven background job queue designed to execute jobs reliably under crashes and shutdowns.

This system guarantees at-least-once execution and explicitly does NOT attempt exactly-once semantics.

If you think exactly-once is required here, you’re wrong. It’s usually a lie built on complexity
